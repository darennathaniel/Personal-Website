Soon enough, I found Front-end Developing as a very exciting task to do! I was tasked to make a hexagonal grid game where 4 teams are assigned to a certain starting point. Each team can only move adjacent to its hexagon. Every time a hexagon is selected, it will either pop a modal of confirmation or telling that they're not allowed to select that modal. It was such an experience as it is my first time using the real React JS!",

Due to the previous project, I got the hang of what React has to offer and its capabilities. I was tasked to have a button to create a card to fill in an order. The procedure is after clicking the button, a modal will pop up asking for the person's data, such as from and to whom it will be sent plus a message. The user is able to edit the card or delete it.",
